Brief description of A* code and current functionality

	- Function createGraph will generate the nodes and edges required for the A* algorithm.

	- The startNode and goalNode will directly set the start and goal node for the algorithm (this will be updated to be based
	on the UAV current position and the chosen landing strip)
	
	- IMPORTANT: set a debug point in the plotPath on line 94 to prevent the simulation from repeating
